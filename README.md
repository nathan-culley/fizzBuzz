This is my attempt at creating FizzBuzz for The Odin Project. The Odin Project only requires that this be a console program, but I was getting rusty on my HTML and CSS at the time of programming this, so I decided to make a full-fledged webpage instead.

First commit: not a full FizzBuzz program. Takes user input of a number from 1 to 100 and checks for divisibility by 3 and 5.
