This is my attempt at creating FizzBuzz for The Odin Project. The Odin Project only requires that this be a console program, but I was getting rusty on my HTML and CSS at the time of programming this, so I decided to make a full-fledged webpage instead.

First commit 2022/06/10: not a full FizzBuzz program. Takes user input of a number from 1 to 100 and checks for divisibility by 3 and 5.

Second commit 2022/06/10: first full working FizzBuzz program. Keeping all my old commented-out code in the file so I can reverse-engineer my thought process if I need to.
